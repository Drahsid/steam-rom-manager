# Executable modifier `[supports variables]`{.noWrap}

Default value is `"${exePath}"`{.noWrap}. This setting can be used to prepend or append desired characters to an executable which will be added to Steam (`Target` property). For example, given that `${exePath}`{.noWrap} is `C:\RetroArch\retroarch.exe`, you can add `"cmd" /k start /min` to it by setting value to:

```
"cmd" /k start /min "${exePath}"
```

You can use any other variable to construct the final executable.

This setting influences Steam's APP ID.

## Shortcut Passthrough

If you enable "Follow .lnk to destination" and your executable is a ".lnk" file, ie a shortcut, then whatever you put in this field will be overridden with the target of that shortcut. If you would like to add executable arguments either add them to the target of the shortcut or use the "Command Line Arguments" field in the parser.
